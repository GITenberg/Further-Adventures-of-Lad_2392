description: "Further Adventures of Lad, also known as Dog Stories Every Child Should\
  \ Know, is a 1922 American novel written by Albert Payson Terhune and published\
  \ by George H. Doran. A follow-up to Lad: A Dog, it contains an additional eleven\
  \ short stories featuring a fictional version of Terhune's real-life rough collie\
  \ Lad, including the stories of Lad's initial arrival at the \"Place\", the death\
  \ of his mate, and the day of his own death. Most of the stories were originally\
  \ published in various magazines, and touch on themes of justice and the concepts\
  \ of right and wrong. Terhune notes that he decided to publish the novel due to\
  \ numerous letters received in response to the first novel, and the thousands of\
  \ visitors who came to Sunnybank to visit the real-life Lad's grave. Though he initially\
  \ intended for Further Adventures of Lad to be the final book of Lad stories, he\
  \ would eventually publish one more book of stories, Lad of Sunnybank in 1929.\n\
  The novel was a bestseller and well received by fans of the first novel, as well\
  \ as new readers. Critics praised the stories as \"charming\" and \"entertaining\"\
  , finding Lad a \"delightful\" and desirable dog. A critic for the New York Tribune,\
  \ however, criticized Terhune's writing style and felt Lad was an unbelievable character,\
  \ while also still noting that book lovers would enjoy it. It was listed among H.W.\
  \ Wilson Company's 1922 list of 10,000 books they deemed the \"most useful\". Warner\
  \ Brothers purchased the film rights for Lad: A Dog, Further Adventures of Lad,\
  \ and Lad of Sunnybank, intending to produce a series of films and possibly a television\
  \ series. The first film, Lad: A Dog, was released in June 1962 but it was unsuccessful\
  \ in the box office and the project was dropped. The novel is now a public domain\
  \ work.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
